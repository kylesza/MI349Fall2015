    <h1>Blog Style Site for Podcast</h1>

  <div>
    <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
      <p>My friends from home and I just started up a podcast, and I currently have a
very basic set-up. I’d like to have more of a blog style website that would have
separate posts for each episode, maybe with a type of comment section. There
would be a type of backlog area where it’d be easier for the user to see older
episodes. Also there would be an “About Us” section that might have separate pages
for each of the hosts. Overall, an easy to navigate website that keeps users on our
site, and not to redirect them somewhere else to listen.

my own social media postings.</p>

and eventually stumbles upon the site and decides to look for more information.
